# ObjectivePixel Origins

![BringCast podcast app showcase](/assets/img/bringcastmerge.jpg)

ObjectivePixel was originally founded in 2010 with a focus on building mobile apps for Windows Phone 7.

Our first product was BringCast, a podcast app developed in collaboration with Mark Osborn. We migrated BringCast through Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10, adapting to Microsoft's evolving mobile platform.

This early work in mobile app development laid the foundation for ObjectivePixel's journey in the tech industry.
