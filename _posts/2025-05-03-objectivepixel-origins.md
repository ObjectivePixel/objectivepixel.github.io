ObjectivePixel is an indie app developer that was originally founded in 2010 by [@Clarkezone](https://twitter.com/clarkezone) in partnership with [@Ozziepeeps](https://twitter.com/ozziepeeps). Our first commercial product was a podcatcher for Windows Phone called BringCast.

BringCast was one of the first apps on the Windows Phone platform for podcasting and had a dedicated user base who we were proud to serve and awesome to support. We evolved BringCast through the Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10 eras, adapting to Microsoft's evolving mobile platform and steadily expanding capabilities.

Over time, [@Ozziepeeps](https://twitter.com/ozziepeeps) decided to step down for family reasons (having kids!) and, as Windows Phone was retired by Microsoft, ObjectivePixel became dormant in 2014.  We removed BringCast from the Windows store when we received a takedown notice due to the design of the app icon.

In 2025, ObjectivePixel is coming out of hybernation with a new mission and a new team. This blog marks the beginning of the next phase.  

We will be documenting our journey from idea to shipping our first app to the Apple App Store and beyond.  We will be reflecting on challenges as well as capturing learnings, tools and resources we discover along the way.  If you are an indie developers thinking about dipping your toe into the app development world we hope this might help you in some small way.
