What an incredible experience attending WWDC 2025 in person for the first time! After years of virtual conferences, I was lucky enough to get selected in the ballot process and got a golden ticket enabling me to attend in person for the first time.  This ment a visit the hallowed grounds of Apple Park with Apple and a select few from the developer community.

Starting with the registration event held at the Infinate Loop campus on Sunday night, I was struct by the scale and diversity of folks attending from companies big and small all over the world The lines to get in said it all.  The welcome reception and experience leaving and getting clapped and cheered on the way out was something I've never experienced previously.

On the morning of the keynote, after an early start and a lot of waiting, those of us at the front of the line finnally made it into the park.  It was a gorgeous sunny warm morning, and we were treated to breakfast outside.  The food was commendable!

As the suspense built towards the keynote, the energy was electric climaxing with Tim and Craig coming out on stage to welcome us.

As the event proceeded, someone pressed play on the keynote video and we were treated to the announcements with the unveiling of "version 26 of all the things" from MacOS to VisionOS and "innovations" such as [Liquid Glass](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/TechnologyOverviews/liquid-glass) and [Foundation Models Framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technologyoverviews/foundation-models).  

Much has been written about those things elsewhere and I'm not going to go through the details here other than to say: I respect those who dislike glass, I'm personally a fan on the changes and seeing them unveiled live I found special. I met some interesting folks in the lines and we had some good chats, funilly related to my day job at Microsoft of all things.

Due to other commitments, I wasn't able to make any side events this year nor any of the in-person sessions on day two which was a shame.  [OMT Conf](https://omt-conf.com) was enjoyable in 2025 and I'm still in touch with some of the folks I met there.

If you are an Apple developer and haven't had a chance to attend WWDC in person, I highly recommend it. It's an incredible experience that you won't find anywhere else.  It's well worth taking a punt and entering the ballot, I hope you make it next time!
