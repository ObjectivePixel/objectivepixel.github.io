ObjectivePixel is an indie app development shop that was originally founded in 2010 by [@Clarkezone](https://twitter.com/clarkezone) in partnership with [@Ozziepeeps](https://twitter.com/ozziepeeps). Our first commercial product was a podcatcher for Windows Phone called BringCast.

BringCast was one of the first apps for podcasting on the Windows Phone platform and had a dedicated user base who were awesome to support. We evolved BringCast through Windows Phone 8 and Windows 10 eras, adapting to Microsoft's evolving mobile platform and steadily expanding capabilities.

Over time, [@Ozziepeeps](https://twitter.com/ozziepeeps) retired for family reasons and ObjectivePixel became dormant in 2014 primarily due to the demise of Windows Phone.

In 2025, ObjectivePixel is coming out of hybernation with a new mission and a new team. This blog marks the beginning of the next phase.
