Today we published our [first app, Remindful to the Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remindful-watch-faces-widget/id6743262426).  Getting to this point has been a long journey, filled with challenges and learning experiences. In future posts, We are excited to share our journey with you and hope you enjoy using Remindful.

The version published today is an MVP of our vision, just about ðŸ™‚.  The primary goal for v1.0 was to just get something in the store getting through the submission and publishing processes.  We have more work to do to get to a more credible first release and that is what we are now working on next.  The update will embody what we consider the initial featureset we really wanted and will be the version we start to market.

If you are a seasoned developer reading this post, we would love to hear your thoughts on the app and how we can improve it.  We are always looking for feedback and suggestions to make Remindful the best it can be.

If you are an indie developer, just getting started we are excited to share our tips with you and encourage you to keep pushing to ship your first app.

If you are a potential user, we would love to have you install this early version and provide feedback on what you think so we can shape the app into something you love.

In any evantuality, if you are reading this post we would love it if you would subscribe to our blog and stay in touch!
